# Intelligent Customer Support Orchestration with UiPath Maestro

An AI-powered customer support automation platform built using **UiPath Maestro**, **Agent Builder**, and **BPMN orchestration**. The solution uses multiple specialized AI agents to triage, resolve, intelligently escalate, review, and continuously learn from customer support tickets.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Customer support teams often spend significant time manually classifying tickets, routing them to the correct department, drafting responses, and documenting resolutions. This solution automates the entire support lifecycle using AI while preserving quality through intelligent routing and review.

The workflow begins by analyzing incoming support tickets, automatically generating a resolution where possible. If the AI determines the issue cannot be confidently resolved, the ticket is routed to the appropriate specialist AI agent based on its category. After specialist review, a Quality Assurance agent validates the response before it is delivered to the customer. Finally, every resolved ticket is converted into a structured knowledge base article, enabling continuous organizational learning.

# 🤖 AI Agents

The workflow consists of the following autonomous AI agents:

| Agent | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **Triage Agent** | Understands the ticket, classifies intent, category, severity, and sentiment. |
| **Resolution Agent** | Determines the root cause, generates a solution, and drafts a customer response. |
| **Routing Agent** | Routes unresolved tickets to the appropriate specialist AI agent. |
| **Support Specialist Agent** | Handles authentication, account access, configuration, and general support issues. |
| **Engineering Specialist Agent** | Handles software defects, API failures, crashes, infrastructure, and technical issues. |
| **Billing Specialist Agent** | Resolves billing, subscription, invoice, payment, and refund requests. |
| **Product Specialist Agent** | Processes feature requests, usability feedback, and product improvement suggestions. |
| **Review Agent** | Performs quality assurance on specialist responses before customer delivery. |
| **Learning Agent** | Converts resolved tickets into structured knowledge base articles for future reuse. |

# 🧠 Routing Logic

When the Resolution Agent returns a confidence score below **80%**, the Escalation Manager Agent determines the most appropriate specialist.

| Issue Type | Assigned Specialist |
|------------|--------------------|
| Login / MFA / Account Access | Support Specialist |
| Bugs / Crashes / API Issues | Engineering Specialist |
| Billing / Refunds / Payments | Billing Specialist |
| Feature Requests / Feedback | Product Specialist |
